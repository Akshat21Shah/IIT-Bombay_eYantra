Here, the whole project is working techically, the email validation part + database part is working compeltely.
I have used Django (Webframework) + POSTgreSQL database to make this project.
Fields are valdiated and stored in the database.
For database working output I have attached db.sqlite3 file which consits the tables & data stored in it.

Thank you
